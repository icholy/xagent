// Package backend defines the interface between the runner's orchestration
// logic and the runtime that hosts task sandboxes (Docker today; Kubernetes,
// ECS, Firecracker, AgentCore later). See
// proposals/accepted/runner-backend-interface.md and
// proposals/draft/shared-runner-taskstate.md.
//
// Backends do runtime work only — launch, probe, signal, destroy, watch — over
// opaque Handles. They never persist, discover, or reconcile task→sandbox
// state: the runner owns the taskstate store and is the only writer. It
// translates between a backend.Handle and a taskstate.Record at the boundary.
