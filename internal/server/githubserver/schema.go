// RegisterSchemas records the eventrouter schema for every event type
// githubserver emits (see toInputEvent) on reg. Each schema declares the
// complete valid attr set for its type (the derived body/url plus its emitted
// dimensions) and the default rules the producer ships. Only the three
// comment/review types carry the "xagent:" body-prefix wakeup default; the rest
// ship no default rules. Every AttrDef is declared inline per event type so its
// display copy (label/help/placeholder) speaks to that specific event: a "Body"
// on an issue comment is the comment text, on an opened PR it is the
// description, rather than sharing a single generic definition. It is exported
// so tests (e.g. eventrouter's Route tests) can populate an isolated registry
// with the real producer schemas.
