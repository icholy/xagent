// This file defines the concrete scope taxonomy that rides on the generic
// matching engine in scope.go: the operation paths, the namespaced attribute
// keys, and the typed attribute constructors that call sites pass to
// Scopes.Allow. It covers both the task-caller surface (the task-token minter
// agentauth.Scopes) and the API-caller surface (the apiserver handlers, which
// enforce per-task scopes directly); see the per-RPC mapping in
// proposals/draft/scope-based-permissions.md §7.

// Operation paths, as segment slices. The single source of truth for each
// operation: scope creation (the runner's token minter, agentauth.Scopes)
// and Allow lookups share these, so the two can't drift. Treat them as
// immutable — never mutate a returned slice. A wildcard operation would be
// expressed the same way, e.g. var OpTaskAny = []string{"task", "*"}.
