// Package authscope implements a scope-matching engine for authorization: a
// scope is a pattern over an (operation-path, attributes) pair, and a caller
// checks a concrete operation-path and attributes against the scopes it holds.
// The matching engine (Scope, Scopes, Allow) is taxonomy-agnostic; the concrete
// task-caller taxonomy it is used with — operation paths, attribute keys, and
// the WithTask* attribute constructors — lives in task.go.
//
// See proposals/draft/scope-based-permissions.md for the design.
