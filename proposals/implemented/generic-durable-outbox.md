# Generic Durable Outbox

Issue: https://github.com/icholy/xagent/issues/1179

## Problem

The runner's `EventQueue` (`internal/runner/eventqueue.go`) buffers `SubmitRunnerEvents`
calls that fail and retries them on the next `Drain`. It exists to ride out transient
connection issues between the runner and the server. It has two structural limitations:

1. **Not durable.** The queue is an in-memory `container/list.List`
   (`eventqueue.go:24`). Events that are enqueued but not yet acknowledged are lost if the
   runner crashes or restarts. That restart-during-outage window is precisely the case the
   queue exists to protect, so a lost `started`/`stopped`/`failed` event leaves the
   server's task state permanently out of sync. The runner already keeps crash-safe on-disk
   state for the task→sandbox mapping (`internal/runner/taskstate`), but the buffer that
   guards state transitions does not.

2. **Not reusable.** The queue is hardcoded to `model.RunnerEvent` and to the
   `SubmitRunnerEvents` RPC (`eventqueue.go:71-74`). Other outbound, failure-prone
   operations want the same "persist, then deliver, then retry with backoff" guarantee but
   cannot use `EventQueue` as written.

The goal is a generic, durable outbox: persist a message before attempting delivery,
survive restarts, retry with backoff, and be parameterized over both the message type and
the delivery mechanism. The runner's event delivery becomes its first consumer.

## Design

A new leaf package `internal/x/outbox` provides a durable, at-least-once outbox generic
over a payload type `T`. It is generic on two axes:

- **Payload type** — `Outbox[T]` carries any JSON-serializable `T` (e.g.
  `model.RunnerEvent`).
- **Backing store** — persistence is behind a small `Store` interface. A filesystem
  implementation ships now (mirroring `taskstate`); a Postgres implementation can be added
  later for server-side consumers without touching the engine or existing callers.

### Delivery semantics

At-least-once, head-of-line-blocking FIFO — preserving the current `EventQueue` contract:

1. `Enqueue` durably persists the message, then wakes the drain loop.
2. `Run` delivers persisted messages in enqueue order (FIFO).
3. On success, the message is removed from the store.
4. On a **transient** error, delivery stops at that message and retries after a backoff;
   later messages stay blocked behind it (matching `Drain`'s current behaviour at
   `eventqueue.go:75-82`).
5. On a **permanent** error, the message is moved to a dead-letter area and delivery
   proceeds to the next message (today `Drain` logs and drops it at `eventqueue.go:76-79`;
   dead-lettering is strictly safer — nothing is silently lost).

Because a message is persisted *before* delivery and removed *after* the delivery call
returns success, a crash between the server's commit and the local remove causes
redelivery. Consumers must therefore be idempotent. This is already true for the runner:
the server's `SubmitRunnerEvents` handler commits its transaction before returning
(`internal/server/apiserver/runner.go`), and the accepted `driver-owned-events` proposal
establishes that duplicate runner events are safe by design.

### Store interface

```go
package outbox

// Record is one persisted, undelivered message. Seq is a per-outbox monotonic
// sequence number that defines delivery (FIFO) order; it is an implementation
// detail of the store's on-disk ordering and logging — callers never address a
// record by it. Payload is the opaque, JSON-encoded T; the store never decodes
// it.
type Record struct {
	Seq     uint64          `json:"seq"`
	Payload json.RawMessage `json:"payload"`
}

// Store is the durable, crash-safe backing store for an outbox: a strict FIFO
// queue. It is single-consumer — the head is stable between a Peek and the Drop
// that follows it — but Append may run concurrently with the consumer.
// Implementations must be safe for concurrent use.
type Store interface {
	// Append durably appends payload to the tail. It must not return until the
	// record is durable.
	Append(payload json.RawMessage) error
	// Peek returns the head record without removing it. ok is false when the
	// queue is empty.
	Peek() (rec Record, ok bool, err error)
	// Drop durably removes the head record. If dead is true the record is moved
	// to the dead-letter area; otherwise it is discarded. Call it after the head
	// has been delivered (dead=false) or judged permanently undeliverable
	// (dead=true). No-op on an empty queue.
	Drop(dead bool) error
	// Len reports the number of live records.
	Len() (int, error)
}
```

Keeping `Peek` and `Drop` separate preserves at-least-once: a combined
return-and-remove would drop a message on a crash between the remove and a
successful delivery.

#### Filesystem implementation (`outbox.FileStore`)

Directly reuses the proven `taskstate` pattern (`taskstate.go:52-95`): one atomic file per
record, backed by an in-memory FIFO of the live records (a `container/list`, mirroring the
`EventQueue` this replaces) that is loaded once at `Open`. Disk is read only at startup;
after that only the head's file is ever touched, and every write stays per-record atomic for
durability.

- Layout: `<dir>/<seq>.json` for live records, `<dir>/dead/<seq>.json` for dead-lettered
  ones, where `<seq>` is a 20-digit zero-padded `uint64` so lexical filename order equals
  numeric `Seq` order.
- `Open`: read + unmarshal every `<uint64>.json` in the live directory into the in-memory
  FIFO in ascending `Seq` order (ignoring temp files and non-`<uint64>.json` names as
  `taskstate.parseRecordName` does at `taskstate.go:165-177`); a live record file that can't
  be read or decoded fails `Open` so corrupt durable state surfaces loudly. Seed the
  in-memory `Seq` counter from the max filename across both the live and dead directories
  (the dead dir is scanned for filenames only), so sequence numbers never repeat even after
  dead-lettering.
- `Append`: assign the next `Seq`, marshal, write via temp-file + `fsync` + atomic `rename`
  (the write is factored into a small stdlib-only `internal/x/atomicio` package, the same
  pattern as `taskstate.Store.Write`), then append the record to the tail.
- `Peek`: return the head record from the in-memory FIFO (no disk access), or `ok == false`
  when empty.
- `Drop(dead bool)`: remove the head from disk — `dead=false` does an idempotent `os.Remove`
  of the head's `<dir>/<seq>.json`, `dead=true` `rename`s it to `<dir>/dead/<seq>.json` — then
  drop it from the front. No-op on an empty queue.
- `Len`: the number of live records.

No new dependency: the filesystem store is stdlib-only, exactly like `taskstate`.

### Outbox engine

```go
package outbox

type Options[T any] struct {
	Store   Store
	Deliver func(ctx context.Context, msg T) (permanent bool, err error) // the RPC/HTTP call
	Backoff backoff.BackOff                                              // retry policy; Reset on success, NextBackOff per failure
	Log     *slog.Logger
}

type Outbox[T any] struct { /* store, wakeup.Chan, opts */ }

func New[T any](opts Options[T]) *Outbox[T]

// Enqueue durably persists msg, then wakes Run. It returns an error only if the
// message could not be persisted.
func (o *Outbox[T]) Enqueue(msg T) error

// Run delivers persisted messages until ctx is cancelled.
func (o *Outbox[T]) Run(ctx context.Context)

// Len reports the number of undelivered messages.
func (o *Outbox[T]) Len() (int, error)
```

`Run` is the durable analogue of today's `Run`/`Drain` pair (`eventqueue.go:66-120`): on
wakeup it drains the store from the head — `Peek` → `Deliver` → `Drop(false)` on success —
looping until `Peek` reports the queue empty. `Deliver` reports whether a failure is permanent
as its first return value, so the code that already holds the error classifies it inline — no
separate predicate. A transient error (`permanent == false`) sleeps for `Backoff.NextBackOff()`
(a `backoff.BackOff` from the already-vendored `github.com/cenkalti/backoff/v5`, replacing the
current fixed `retryInterval`) and retries from the same head; a permanent error
(`permanent == true`) calls `Drop(true)` to dead-letter it and advances to the next head.
`Run` calls `Backoff.Reset()` whenever the store fully drains, so each new failure streak
starts from the initial interval. Because `Drop` runs only *after* `Deliver` returns success,
a crash between delivery and `Drop` simply redelivers the head on restart — the at-least-once
payoff. On startup, `Run`'s first pass naturally redelivers everything already persisted, so
it requires no separate recovery path.

In sketch, the loop is a faithful durable copy of `EventQueue.Drain`:

```go
for {
	rec, ok, err := store.Peek()
	if err != nil { /* log; back off */ }
	if !ok { break } // drained
	permanent, err := deliver(ctx, decode(rec.Payload))
	switch {
	case err == nil:
		store.Drop(false) // delivered → discard head
	case permanent:
		store.Drop(true) // permanent → dead-letter head
	default:
		// transient → backoff, leave head
	}
}
```

`Backoff` defaults to a capped exponential policy when nil; passing
`backoff.NewConstantBackOff(interval)` reproduces the current fixed-interval behaviour for a
drop-in match.

### Runner adoption (first consumer)

`internal/runner/eventqueue.go` is deleted and replaced by a thin construction of
`outbox.Outbox[model.RunnerEvent]` in `internal/command/runner.go` (currently
`runner.go:143-147`, `runner.go:221`):

```go
ob := outbox.New[model.RunnerEvent](outbox.Options[model.RunnerEvent]{
	Store: outboxStore, // outbox.FileStore under the runner state dir, next to taskstate
	Deliver: func(ctx context.Context, ev model.RunnerEvent) (permanent bool, err error) {
		_, err = client.SubmitRunnerEvents(ctx, &xagentv1.SubmitRunnerEventsRequest{
			Events: []*xagentv1.RunnerEvent{ev.Proto()},
		})
		return isPermanentError(err), err
	},
	Log: log,
})
...
go ob.Run(ctx)
```

The five `queue.Enqueue(...)` call sites in `internal/runner/runner.go` (lines 170, 194,
233, 302, 305) keep the same `Enqueue(model.RunnerEvent)` shape. `Enqueue` now returns an
error (persistence can fail); the runner logs it, exactly as other local-IO failures are
handled today. `isPermanentError` and its Connect-code set (`eventqueue.go:91-98`) move into
the runner wiring unchanged.

The outbox directory lives under the runner's existing state directory (the parent of the
`taskstate` dir), so it participates in the same lifecycle and cleanup as task state.

### Reuse candidates (motivating "other places")

The generic engine + pluggable `Store` is what makes these tractable later; they are **not**
in scope for this proposal, only enumerated to validate the shape:

- **Driver → server events** (`internal/agent/driver.go`) — the in-container driver makes
  the same `SubmitRunnerEvents` call and could use an `Outbox[model.RunnerEvent]` over a
  container-local `FileStore`.
- **Server-side notification publishing** (`internal/server/apiserver/runner.go`,
  `internal/pubsub`) — a fan-out that today is best-effort after the DB commit; a Postgres
  `Store` implementation would let the server enqueue notifications transactionally and
  deliver them durably. This is the concrete motivation for keeping `Store` an interface.

### No proto changes

This is an internal reliability change. `SubmitRunnerEvents` and every other RPC are
untouched; the wire format and server handlers are unchanged.

## Implementation Plan

A layer cake of small, independently reviewable PRs. Each foundational layer is safe to
merge before the ones above it land.

1. **Outbox store interface + filesystem implementation** — Delivers: the `outbox` package
   with the `Store` interface, `Record`, and `FileStore` (atomic per-record files, seq
   ordering, dead-letter dir), ported from the `taskstate` pattern. No engine yet.
   Depends on: nothing. Verifiable by: unit tests over a temp dir — FIFO append/peek/drop
   ordering, durable drop (gone after re-`Open`), dead-letter move, seq monotonicity across
   restart (re-`Open` the dir), `Open` failing on a corrupt record, and ignoring of
   temp/garbage files.

2. **Outbox engine** — Delivers: `Outbox[T]`, `Options[T]`, `Enqueue`/`Run`/`Len`, backoff
   on transient errors, dead-letter on permanent errors. Depends on: (1). Verifiable by:
   unit tests with an in-memory fake `Store` and a scripted `Deliver` func — FIFO order,
   head-of-line blocking on transient failure, dead-letter + continue on permanent failure,
   redelivery of a pre-seeded store on startup, backoff timing.

3. **Runner adoption** — Delivers: delete `internal/runner/eventqueue.go`, wire
   `outbox.Outbox[model.RunnerEvent]` + a `FileStore` in `internal/command/runner.go`, move
   `isPermanentError`, keep the `Enqueue` call sites. Depends on: (2). Verifiable by:
   porting the existing `eventqueue_test.go` cases to the new wiring and a runner
   integration test asserting events survive a simulated restart (enqueue → drop the
   in-memory outbox → re-`Open` the dir → deliver).

Later, out of scope here: a Postgres `Store` implementation and the server/driver consumers
above, each a self-contained follow-up that depends only on layers (1)–(2).

## Trade-offs

- **Filesystem store vs. embedded DB (SQLite/bbolt).** The filesystem store adds zero
  dependencies and reuses a pattern already trusted for runner state (`taskstate`), and the
  outbox's access pattern (append, list-in-order, delete-head, small N) is exactly what that
  pattern serves well. An embedded DB would give indexed queries and transactions we don't
  need here; it's deferred behind the `Store` interface if a consumer ever needs it.

- **Head-of-line blocking retained.** Keeping strict FIFO with head-of-line blocking matches
  the current `EventQueue` contract and the ordering guarantees the runner's task state
  machine relies on. Per-key parallel delivery would improve throughput but change
  semantics; it's deliberately out of scope.

- **At-least-once, not exactly-once.** Persist-before-deliver plus remove-after-ack makes
  duplicates possible on crash. Exactly-once would require delivery de-duplication on the
  server. Since runner event consumers are already idempotent (per `driver-owned-events`),
  at-least-once is the right cost/benefit point.

- **Dead-letter vs. drop.** The current queue logs-and-drops permanent errors. Moving them to
  a dead-letter directory instead is strictly safer (nothing vanishes) at the cost of a
  little disk and an eventual cleanup story.

## Open Questions

- **Dead-letter retention.** Do dead-lettered records need a retention/cleanup policy
  (age-based prune, or a `report` to the server), or is manual inspection enough initially?

- **Backoff defaults.** What cap and initial interval should the default exponential policy
  use? The current runner uses a fixed `--poll` interval (default 30s); a sensible default
  might be initial 1s, factor 2, cap 30s.

- **Enqueue failure policy.** If `Enqueue`'s durable write fails (disk full), the runner
  currently has no fallback. Should it fall back to a best-effort in-memory hold, or is
  logging + relying on runner reconciliation (`Runner.Load`) on the next restart sufficient?
