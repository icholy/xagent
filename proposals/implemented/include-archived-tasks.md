# Include Archived Tasks in the Task List

Issue: https://github.com/icholy/xagent/issues/1334

## Problem

The task list excludes archived tasks entirely. Archiving is a soft-delete — the rows stay in the `tasks` table — but `archived = FALSE` is hard-coded into every listing surface:

- `ListTasksPage` (`internal/store/sql/queries/task.sql`) — `WHERE archived = FALSE`.
- The partial keyset index `tasks_org_created_id_idx` — `WHERE archived = FALSE`.
- The `ListTasks` RPC handler, the Web UI task list (`webui/src/routes/tasks.index.tsx`), the `list_tasks` MCP tool, and the `xagent task list` CLI — all consume that query.

Once a task is archived (manually or by the auto-archive loop) it disappears from the UI and every listing surface. A user who wants to revisit an old, archived investigation — or confirm that auto-archive fired — has no path back to it short of knowing the id and deep-linking to `/tasks/{id}`. This matters more over time: auto-archive (#633) is making archived tasks the *majority* of an org's history, all of it invisible.

We want an **optional** way to include archived tasks in the list, **off by default**, without regressing the normal (active-only) view or the keyset pagination that just landed for `ListTasks` (`proposals/implemented/task-pagination.md`). That proposal's Open Questions anticipated this: a "show archived" toggle becomes another request field that changes which rows the keyset scan visits, and the cursor's JSON blob was kept flexible so it can carry the filter.

## Design

### Overview

Add a single `archived` boolean to `ListTasksRequest`. When false (the default), the list behaves exactly as today: active tasks only. When true, the query drops the `archived = FALSE` predicate and returns active **and** archived tasks interleaved by `created_at DESC, id DESC`. The partial keyset index is replaced with a full one so a single index backs both paths. The page token binds the filter so a cursor minted under one filter cannot be silently replayed under the other. The Web UI gains a "Show archived" switch beside the page-size selector; archived rows are marked with the existing `ArchivedBadge` and muted. The CLI gains a matching opt-in flag; the MCP `list_tasks` tool is left out of scope.

The keyset itself does not change shape semantically — the ordering is still `created_at DESC, id DESC`, and archived rows simply take their place in that ordering. That is what makes this an additive change rather than a rework of the cursor.

### 1. Request field shape

`proto/xagent/v1/xagent.proto` — add one field to the existing request:

```protobuf
message ListTasksRequest {
  int32 page_size = 1;     // Max tasks to return (default: 50, max: 100)
  string page_token = 2;   // Opaque cursor from a previous next_page_token; empty for the first page
  bool archived = 3;       // Include archived tasks alongside active ones (default: false)
}
```

`archived = false` (the proto3 default, and what every existing empty-request caller sends) preserves today's behavior exactly. `true` means "active **and** archived," matching the mental model of a "Show archived" toggle — it *adds* archived rows to the active list rather than replacing it.

A bool rather than a filter enum is chosen deliberately; see [Trade-offs](#archived-bool-vs-a-filter-enum). The response (`ListTasksResponse`) is unchanged — the `Task.archived` field (already present, tag 13) is what lets clients distinguish rows.

### 2. SQL query

`internal/store/sql/queries/task.sql` — make the archived predicate conditional on a new arg:

```sql
-- name: ListTasksPage :many
SELECT id, name, runner, workspace, status, command, version, org_id, archived, created_at, updated_at, auto_archive, shell_session
FROM tasks
WHERE org_id = sqlc.arg(org_id)
  AND (sqlc.arg(archived)::bool OR archived = FALSE)
  AND (
    NOT sqlc.arg(use_cursor)::bool
    OR (created_at, id) < (sqlc.arg(cursor_created_at)::timestamp, sqlc.arg(cursor_id)::bigint)
  )
ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC
LIMIT sqlc.arg(page_limit);
```

When the `archived` arg is true the `archived = FALSE` half of the disjunction drops out and the scan visits all of the org's rows in `created_at DESC, id DESC` order. The keyset predicate `(created_at, id) < (cursor)` is untouched and remains correct, because the ordering the cursor anchors to is identical in both modes — archived rows are just interleaved by timestamp. The over-fetch-and-trim and token building inside `pagination.List` are unaffected.

### 3. Pagination index

The existing index is **partial** — it only contains non-archived rows:

```sql
CREATE INDEX tasks_org_created_id_idx
  ON tasks (org_id, created_at DESC, id DESC)
  WHERE archived = FALSE;
```

The planner can only use a partial index for a query whose predicate implies the index's `WHERE`. The default (`archived = false`) path carries `archived = FALSE` and uses it fine. But the `archived = true` path has no such predicate, so it *cannot* use the partial index — and there is no other ordered index over `(org_id, created_at, id)` for it to fall back to, so the keyset scan collapses into fetching all of the org's tasks via `idx_tasks_org_id` and top-N sorting on every page. A keyset cursor can't resume a scan that has no ordered index beneath it.

**Replace the partial index with a full one** — drop the `WHERE archived = FALSE` clause so a single index serves both the default and the `archived = true` paged scans:

```sql
-- migrate:up
DROP INDEX tasks_org_created_id_idx;
CREATE INDEX tasks_org_created_id_idx
  ON tasks (org_id, created_at DESC, id DESC);

-- migrate:down
DROP INDEX tasks_org_created_id_idx;
CREATE INDEX tasks_org_created_id_idx
  ON tasks (org_id, created_at DESC, id DESC)
  WHERE archived = FALSE;
```

The index keeps its name and key columns; only the partial predicate is removed. Now both paths are ordered index range scans with no sort:

- The default active-only scan applies `archived = FALSE` as a filter *on top of* the full-index range scan — it walks the index in `created_at DESC, id DESC` order and skips the archived entries interleaved among the active ones.
- The `archived = true` scan walks the same index with no filter.

This is one index doing both jobs rather than two indexes doing one each; see [Trade-offs](#replace-the-partial-index-vs-keep-it-and-add-a-full-one) for the maintenance-vs-hot-path reasoning and the accepted cost.

### 4. Store layer

`internal/store/task.go` — thread the flag through `ListTasksPageParams`, the SQL args, and the cursor.

```go
type ListTasksPageParams struct {
	OrgID     int64
	PageSize  int32  // 0 means the default (50); max 100
	PageToken string // opaque token from a previous page; empty for the first page
	Archived  bool   // include archived tasks alongside active ones
}

// taskCursor is the keyset a task page token encodes. created_at is not
// unique, so id is the tiebreaker. Archived binds the token to the filter it
// was minted under so a cursor can't be replayed across filters.
type taskCursor struct {
	CreatedAt time.Time `json:"c"`
	ID        int64     `json:"i"`
	Archived  bool      `json:"a,omitempty"`
}

func (src taskSource) Query(ctx context.Context, cursor *taskCursor, limit int32) ([]*model.Task, error) {
	if cursor != nil && cursor.Archived != src.params.Archived {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("%w: page token does not match archived filter", pagination.ErrInvalidRequest)
	}
	args := sqlc.ListTasksPageParams{
		OrgID:     src.params.OrgID,
		Archived:  src.params.Archived,
		UseCursor: cursor != nil,
		PageLimit: limit,
	}
	if cursor != nil {
		args.CursorCreatedAt = cursor.CreatedAt
		args.CursorID = cursor.ID
	}
	rows, err := src.store.q(src.tx).ListTasksPage(ctx, args)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return toModelTasks(rows)
}

func (src taskSource) Cursor(t *model.Task) taskCursor {
	return taskCursor{CreatedAt: t.CreatedAt, ID: t.ID, Archived: src.params.Archived}
}
```

Two things to note:

- **Token binds the filter.** `Cursor` stamps the request's `Archived` into every token it mints; `Query` rejects a cursor whose stamp disagrees with the current request, returning a wrapped `pagination.ErrInvalidRequest` (→ `CodeInvalidArgument`). This is entirely contained in the store's `taskSource`; the generic `internal/pagination` package is untouched — it already treats the cursor as an opaque `C` it only JSON-marshals. See [Trade-offs](#binding-the-filter-into-the-token-vs-leaving-it-free).
- `json:"a,omitempty"` keeps the common (`false`) token byte-compatible with tokens minted before this change, so in-flight tokens from the active-only path keep decoding.

### 5. Server handler

`internal/server/apiserver/task.go` — pure pass-through, one new line:

```go
page, err := s.store.ListTasksPage(ctx, nil, store.ListTasksPageParams{
	OrgID:     caller.OrgID,
	PageSize:  req.PageSize,
	PageToken: req.PageToken,
	Archived:  req.Archived,
})
```

The existing `errors.Is(err, pagination.ErrInvalidRequest)` → `CodeInvalidArgument` mapping now also covers the token/filter-mismatch case for free. No scope change: `archived` reads the same rows the caller can already read for their org; `OpTaskRead` still gates it.

### 6. Web UI

`webui/src/routes/tasks.index.tsx` — add a "Show archived" `Switch` (the component exists at `webui/src/components/ui/switch.tsx`) beside the page-size `Select`, persisted per-org like the page size:

```tsx
const [showArchived, setShowArchived] = useOrgLocalStorage('tasks-show-archived', 'false')
const archived = showArchived === 'true'

const { data, isLoading, error, isPlaceholderData, refetch } = useQuery(
  listTasks,
  { pageSize: Number(pageSize), pageToken, archived },
  { placeholderData: keepPreviousData, refetchInterval: 60000 },
)

// Flipping the toggle invalidates the cursor stack (the token is filter-bound),
// so restart from the first page — exactly how page-size changes already behave.
const handleShowArchivedChange = (checked: boolean) => {
  setShowArchived(checked ? 'true' : 'false')
  setTokens([])
}
```

`useOrgLocalStorage` stores strings and ignores empty writes, so `'true'`/`'false'` round-trip cleanly. Resetting `tokens` on toggle mirrors the existing `handlePageSizeChange` and means the UI never replays a filter-bound token under the wrong filter — the store's rejection is a backstop, not a path the UI exercises.

**Distinguishing archived rows.** The `ArchivedBadge` component (`webui/src/components/archived-badge.tsx`) already renders a muted "archived" badge when `task.archived` and `null` otherwise — reuse it. In `TaskRow`, render it next to the task name, and mute the row when archived:

```tsx
<TableRow className={task.archived ? 'text-muted-foreground' : undefined}>
  <TableCell>
    <Link ...>{task.name || `Unnamed - ${task.id}`}</Link>
    <ArchivedBadge task={task} />
  </TableCell>
  ...
```

The archive action column already gates on `canArchiveTask(task)`, which is false for archived tasks, so archived rows simply show no archive button — no extra handling needed. Run `pnpm lint` in `webui/` before finishing (CI enforces ESLint).

### 7. CLI

`xagent task list` (`internal/command/task_list.go`) sends an empty `ListTasksRequest` today and only ever sees the first page (it doesn't paginate). Add a bool flag threaded into the request:

```go
&cli.BoolFlag{
	Name:  "archived",
	Usage: "include archived tasks",
},
// ...
resp, err := client.ListTasks(ctx, &xagentv1.ListTasksRequest{
	Archived: cmd.Bool("archived"),
})
```

It defaults to false, so existing scripts are unchanged.

The `list_tasks` **MCP tool is out of scope** for this proposal — it stays active-only. It can adopt the same `archived` field later as a backward-compatible addition if an agent use case appears, but it isn't driving this work.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Proto field** — Delivers: `archived` on `ListTasksRequest` + regenerated Go/TS (`mise run generate`, webui buf generate). Depends on: nothing. Verifiable by: generated code compiles; field present in both stubs.
2. **Index migration** — Delivers: a migration that drops `tasks_org_created_id_idx` and recreates it without the `WHERE archived = FALSE` clause (full keyset index). Depends on: nothing. Verifiable by: `dbmate up`/`down` run cleanly; `\d tasks` shows the index with no partial predicate (and the partial predicate restored on `down`).
3. **SQL query + store** — Delivers: conditional `archived` predicate in `ListTasksPage`, `Archived` on `ListTasksPageParams`/`taskCursor`, filter threading + token-mismatch rejection (`sqlc generate`). Depends on: (2). Verifiable by: store tests — active-only unchanged; archived-included returns archived rows in keyset order; a token minted under one filter is rejected under the other with `ErrInvalidRequest`.
4. **Server handler** — Delivers: pass `req.Archived` through. Depends on: (1), (3). Verifiable by: handler test paging with `archived` true/false; mismatch → `CodeInvalidArgument`.
5. **Web UI** — Delivers: "Show archived" switch (reset tokens on change), archived badge + muted row. Depends on: (4). Verifiable by: rendering against an org with archived tasks; toggling shows/hides them and resets to page 1; `pnpm lint` passes.
6. **CLI** — Delivers: a `--archived` flag on `xagent task list`. Depends on: (4). Verifiable by: `xagent task list --archived` returns archived tasks; default omits them.

## Trade-offs

### `archived` bool vs a filter enum

**Chosen: a bool.** The feature the issue asks for is a binary toggle — "also show archived." A bool expresses exactly that, is the proto3 default-false so every existing caller is unaffected, and keeps the query a one-line conditional. A broader enum (e.g. `TaskFilter { ACTIVE, ARCHIVED, ALL }`, or a repeated status filter) would additionally allow "archived **only**," which no surface currently needs — both the UI toggle and the CLI want "active, optionally plus archived." An enum is also a larger, harder-to-narrow API commitment. If an "archived only" view or status filtering is wanted later, it can be added as a *separate* additive field (or the bool can be widened to an enum in a backward-compatible way) without redoing this work. Starting narrow avoids designing a filter language on speculation, matching how the pagination proposal deferred its `pg_trgm` search filter until there was demand.

### Replace the partial index vs keep it and add a full one

**Chosen: replace the partial index with a single full one.** The `archived = true` paged scan *needs* an ordered index over `(org_id, created_at, id)` that includes archived rows — without one it degrades to fetching all of the org's tasks via `idx_tasks_org_id` and top-N sorting on every page, because a keyset cursor cannot resume a scan that has no ordered index beneath it. So the only real question is whether to make the existing keyset index full, or keep it partial and add a *second* full index beside it.

Keeping both would preserve a minimal, dense index for the hot (non-archived) view, but it pays **double index maintenance on every task write, forever** — every insert and every non-HOT update touches both indexes — to optimize a read path that is already cheap. One full index is the simpler trade: a single index serves both scans and there's only one to maintain.

The **accepted cost** of replacing: the non-archived list now scans an index interleaved with archived entries and filters them out, so the common view degrades *gradually* as an org's archive grows (auto-archive, #633, means the archived fraction only rises). At current scale this is negligible — the filter is cheap and the extra index entries walked are bounded by the archived-to-active ratio — but it is a real, if slow, regression on the hot path and is called out here explicitly. If it ever bites, re-introducing a partial index as a second index is the escape hatch.

A composite `(org_id, archived, created_at DESC, id DESC)` is **not** a rescue: with no `archived` predicate in the `archived = true` query, the leading `archived` column splits the btree into two separately-ordered ranges, so there is no single ordered scan across both — exactly what the keyset needs. It also doesn't help the default path enough to justify itself.

Runner polling is a non-factor in this decision: `ListTasksForRunner` is anchored on `idx_tasks_runner_status` (a runner-equality prefix) and never reads archived rows, so it is unaffected by the keyset index's shape.

### Binding the filter into the token vs leaving it free

**Chosen: bind the filter into the token.** The keyset `(created_at, id)` is technically valid under either filter — the ordering is the same — so replaying a token across filters would not *corrupt* results; it would resume from that position over whichever row set the new filter selects. But it is a latent footgun: a caller that flips `archived` while paging would get a page that is internally consistent yet mismatched with what the toggle now claims to show, with no error. Because the pagination proposal deliberately kept the token an opaque JSON blob "flexible" for exactly this, stamping `Archived` into the cursor and rejecting a mismatched replay is nearly free (one field, one comparison in `taskSource.Query`) and turns a confusing silent-inconsistency into a clear `CodeInvalidArgument`. The `omitempty` tag keeps the default-false token wire-compatible with tokens already in flight.

The alternative — leave the token filter-agnostic and just document "reset pagination when you change the filter" — is simpler and would be fine for the UI alone (which already resets the token stack on toggle, as it does on page-size change). It was rejected because it pushes a correctness expectation onto every non-UI client (CLI scripts, future API consumers) that the server can cheaply enforce instead. Binding is defensive rather than strictly required; a reviewer who prefers the minimal change can drop the `taskCursor` field and the `Query` check without affecting the rest of the design.

### CLI included, MCP tool deferred

**Chosen: surface on the Web UI and CLI, leave the MCP tool out of scope.** The store change makes archived tasks reachable through the shared `ListTasksPage`; exposing the flag on the CLI is a couple of lines and matches the primary human surface (a script auditing archived work). The `list_tasks` MCP tool is deliberately left active-only for now — there's no established agent use case for browsing archived tasks, and if one appears the same `archived` field is a backward-compatible addition (it would also want `archived` added to `taskSummary` so an agent can tell the rows apart). Both surfaces stay default-false, so nothing changes for callers that don't ask.

## Open Questions

1. **Archived-only view.** This proposal intentionally omits "archived **only**." If it turns out users want to browse *just* the archive (not active + archived interleaved), is that a third UI state (a tri-state select instead of a switch) plus widening the bool to an enum — or is "show archived + eyeball the badges" enough?
2. **Row styling depth.** Muting the row text + the existing `ArchivedBadge` is the proposed minimum. Is that sufficient contrast, or should archived rows also get a distinct background / be visually grouped below active ones? (Grouping fights the single `created_at DESC` keyset ordering, so interleaved-with-badge is the low-friction default.)
3. **Default page size when archived included.** With archived rows included, an org's list is much longer. The default page size (20 in the UI, 50 in the RPC) is unchanged here — do we want a different default when the toggle is on, or is prev/next paging enough?
